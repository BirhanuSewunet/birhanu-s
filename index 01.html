<P>
  Ethiopiaâ€™s population is highly diverse with different languages and ethnic groups. Most of its people speak an
  Ethiosemitic or Cushitic language which are both part of the Afroasiatic language family, while others speak
  Nilo-Saharan languages. The Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans make up more than three-quarters (75%) of the
  population, but there are more than 80 different ethnic groups within Ethiopia. Some of these have as few as 10,000
  members. English is the most widely spoken foreign language and is taught in all secondary schools. Amharic was the
  language of primary school instruction but has been replaced in many areas by local languages such as Afan Oromo, Somali
  and Tigrinya.
